# Employee_Record_Manager

The purpose of this project is to help maintain the database record of all the employees working in an organization. It is not easy to handle the records of each employee manually, so we designed this software where the employee can input his data and the data will be stored in our database. It also has an admin section where the admin has more rights on data handling.
